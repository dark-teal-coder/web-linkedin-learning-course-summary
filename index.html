            <ul>
                <li>Sending and receiving or uploading and downloading files across a network</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Many web hosts offer FTP servers for customers to upload and download files</li>
        <li>Many companies host software update files, drivers and the like</li>
        <li>FTP servers for open-source projects are common</li>
        <li>Many Linux distributions have a wide network of FTP sites/mirrors</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Mirrors contain the same information where installation disc images can be downloaded</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Public FTP access generally discouraged outside a network firewall</li>
        <li>FTP servers: 1) login credentials 2) anonymous access</li>
        <li>FTP security:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Credentials as plain text</li>
                <li>Best practice: unique credentials for access</li>
                <li>Alternatives include FTP-SSL & SFTP</li>
            </ul>
        <li>FTP connection URL:</li>

                        <li>FTP usually listens for commands on transmission control protocol (TCP) port 21</li>
                        <li>The client and server will open other ports for data transfer automatically if the firewall allows</li>

        <li><span class="math display">\[Profit = Revenue - Cost\]</span></li>
        <li>Revenue: amount of money collected from customers</li>
        <li>Companies have multiple revenue streams</li>
            <ul>
                <li>E.g., Starbucks
                    <ol>
                        <li>collecting money by selling coffee, food and other merchandise at their stores</li>
                        <li>selling the ingredients and equipment used to make food and coffee to certified Starbucks shops</li>
                        <li>selling Starbucks coffee beans and pre-packaged beverages in grocery stores, etc.</li>

        <li>Tough job to manage a company to profitability</li>
            <ul>
                <li>E.g., Increasing marketing costs might sell more coffee but the revenue might not be big enough to cover the advertising costs</li>
                <li>E.g., Buying cheaper coffee beans would decrease material costs but customers might not like cheap coffees and stop buying from us</li>
