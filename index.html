        Video: Welcome
        <ul>
            <li>FTP: File Transfer Protocol</li>
            <li>FTP is a common way of moving files around across networks and the internet</li>
            <li>Popular for managing files on host services</li>
        </ul>
        Video: What You Should Know
        <ul>
            <li>Be familiar with using your operating system</li>
            <li>Be comfortable installing applications</li>
            <li>This course is built around the idea of working with files on a web host</li>
        </ul>
        Video: Using the Exercise Files
        <ul>
            <li>Access to your own server to follow along with this course</li>

        Video: What Is FTP?
        <ul>
            <li>FTP: File Transfer Protocol</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sending and receiving or uploading and downloading files across a network</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Many web hosts offer FTP servers for customers to upload and download files</li>
            <li>Many companies host software update files, drivers and the like</li>
            <li>FTP servers for open-source projects are common</li>
            <li>Many Linux distributions have a wide network of FTP sites/mirrors</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mirrors contain the same information where installation disc images can be downloaded</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Public FTP access generally discouraged outside a network firewall</li>
            <li>FTP servers: 1) login credentials 2) anonymous access</li>
            <li>FTP security:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credentials as plain text</li>
                    <li>Best practice: unique credentials for access</li>
                    <li>Alternatives include FTP-SSL & SFTP</li>
                </ul>
            <li>FTP connection URL:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Structure: <span class="code">{protocol} + {username} + [:] + {password} + [@] + {hostname/address} + [:] + {port} + [/] + {file path}</span></li>
                    <li>E.g., ftp://mary:abc123@example.com:21/file.zip</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The credential (username & password) can be omitted but it will be prompted if so</li>
                            <li>FTP usually listens for commands on transmission control protocol (TCP) port 21</li>
                            <li>The client and server will open other ports for data transfer automatically if the firewall allows</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>FTP URL can be viewed in:</li>

                    <li>Text: file sent as ASCII characters</li>
                    <li>Binary: file sent as byte stream</li>
                    <li>Automatic: mode auto-selected</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Home folder: landing place in the file system after login</li>

        Video: Exploring SFTP
        <ul>
            <li>SFTP: SSH file transfer protocol</li>
            <li>SSH connection instead of FTP</li>
            <li>Encrypted</li>
            <li>Just required to open one port to the outside world</li>
            <li>SFTP routes through one port (default 22)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easier to control</li>
                    <li>More resilient to different network environments</li>
                </ul>
            <li>To connect:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type [sftp] + {username} + [@] + {domain}</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>E.g., <span class="code">sftp dark.teal.coder@example.com</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>To specify a port: type [sftp] + [-oPort=] + {option} + {username} + [@] + {domain}</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>E.g., <span class="code">sftp -oPort=2222 dark.teal.coder@example.com</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>In case @ sign in the username: type [sftp] + [-oUser=] + {username} + [@] + {domain in the username} + {server’s domain}</li>
                        <ul>

        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/understanding-business">Course URL</a>
        <br>
        Video: Making a Profit
        <ul>
            <li>Profit: amount of money remaining after a company pays all its bills</li>
            <li><span class="math display">\[Profit = Revenue - Cost\]</span></li>
            <li>Revenue: amount of money collected from customers</li>
            <li>Companies have multiple revenue streams</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., Starbucks
                        <ol>
                            <li>collecting money by selling coffee, food and other merchandise at their stores</li>
                            <li>selling the ingredients and equipment used to make food and coffee to certified Starbucks shops</li>
                            <li>selling Starbucks coffee beans and pre-packaged beverages in grocery stores, etc.</li>
                        </ol>
                </ul>
            <li>Costs: wages, supplies, insurance, real estate, to-go containers, etc.</li>
            <li>Tough job to manage a company to profitability</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., Increasing marketing costs might sell more coffee but the revenue might not be big enough to cover the advertising costs</li>
                    <li>E.g., Buying cheaper coffee beans would decrease material costs but customers might not like cheap coffees and stop buying from us</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        Video: Parts of the Business
        <ul>
            <li>Company success requires a team effort</li>
            <li>In huge organizations, leaders build teams made up of individuals with different strengths and capabilities</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finance: responsible for getting money via loans or from investors</li>

                </ul>
        </ul>
        Video: Three Flows
        <ul>
            <li>Elements of continuous flow:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Money</li>
                    <li>Material</li>
                    <li>Information</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Money: money flows from customers to company and then to suppliers</li>
            <li>Material: customers expect a quick and efficient flow of goods</li>
            <li>Information: information helps anticipate the next order</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., Suppliers want to know how much products have been sold and how much left in the inventory</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Every employee contributes to good flow</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Two methods to raise capital:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Debt financing: borrowing money</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>E.g., A shop owner goes to a bank to borrow a loan</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Equity financing: raising money by selling ownership in the company</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>E.g., A company can sell bonds</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
            <li>Bonds: small loans from individuals instead of banks</li>
            <li>Three types of equity financing:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Using retained earnings</li>
                    <li>Selling stock</li>

                    <li>For both big and small businesses</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Stock shares: dividing ownership of the company into shares and selling them to the public</li>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            <li>Venture capital funding: selling ownership in the company to private investors</li>

            <li>Finance team: responsible for acquiring the cash & figuring out how to best use the money</li>

            <li>ROI as a percentage representing how much your initial investment has grown</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., Investing $100,000 to start a coffee shop and selling it for $250,000 four years later, profit/return of $150,000, ROI = 1.5 or 150% (return 1.5 times greater than the initial investment)</li>
